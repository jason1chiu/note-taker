## Description
My motivation for this project was to provide a valuable tool for small business owners to help them organize their thoughts and tasks, and ultimately increase their productivity and success. I built this project to address the needs of small business owners who require an efficient and user-friendly note-taking application to help them manage their work effectively, ultimately leading to increased productivity and success. This project solves the problem of disorganization and lack of productivity for small business owners by providing a reliable and user-friendly note-taking application to help them manage their thoughts and tasks effectively. Creating this application using Express.js allowed me to learn the benefits of using a robust web framework, including simplified routing and middleware management, which helped to streamline the development process and create a more efficient and scalable application.

## Usage
Upon opening the note-taking application, you will be directed to a landing page that includes a link to access the note-taking functionality. Once on the notes page, the right-hand column enables you to input the title and text for a new note. Upon completion, a Save icon will be displayed at the top of the page. By clicking the Save icon, your newly created note will be saved and appear alongside previously existing notes in the left-hand column. To view an existing note, simply select it from the left-hand column, and it will appear in the right-hand column. If you wish to delete a previous note, click on the note from the left-hand column, and then select the Delete icon located in the navigation at the top of the page.
